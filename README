Legal:
The books and preview pages are published on Google Books basing on agreements 
with book authors and publishers. Nevertheless before making any specific use 
of downloaded books, you need to confirm the legality of your own actions. The 
rules regarding public domain materials differ from country to country, and 
sometimes the specific use is not allowed. That is why a book's inclusion in 
Google Books doesnâ€™t mean it can be used in any manner anywhere in the world. 
For example, Google recommends not to engage in large scale redistribution or 
rehosting of the book files, sell digital or physical book copies, or help other 
people buy and sell them.
